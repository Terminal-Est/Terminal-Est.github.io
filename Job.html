            Why I think this job is for me
        </h3>
        <p>
            This position is for a Systems Engineer maintaining servers in a government body that supports Engineers and Scientist working in various industries. I feel this position is
            appealing to be because it combines many of the different IT disciplines I have an interest in such as Unix/Linux server administration, diagnostics/troubleshooting and
            scripting. A link to the full Job description can be found <a href="https://www.michaelpage.com.au/job-detail/systems-engineer/ref/107444633">Here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Skills required for the Job
        </h3>
        <p>
            Key skills required for this job are a sound knowledge of Unix/Linux/Windows administration, ability to write scripts in multiple languages that will facilitate
            automating different administrative tasks. The different qualifications that might be required or desired are a CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate), an MCSA (Microsoft Certified Solutions
            Associate) in the relevant Microsoft platforms employed and at least a Bachelors in Information Technology with a focus on network environments. Also mentioned is Level 3 technical support.
            Level 3 support typically deals with higher level issues such as infrastructure issues, database administration and the ability to deploy solutions to new problems
            Soft skills that would be required for the job are good interpersonal skills, strong communication skills and an ability to work well in a team.
        </p>
        <p>
            The soft skills that I have that would be applicable to the job would be strong technical problem solving skills, attention to detail and a good work ethic.
            I currently have some experience with Linux operating systems and limited networking experience through my job as a Process Control Technician. I hold a Certificate IV Systems Electrician/Instrument technician that probably won't be applicable to the position.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Skills pathway
        </h3>
