            Myers-Briggs personality test
        </h3>
        <p>
            According to the online personality test 16personalities.com, I returned an INTJ-T type personality <b>(Figure 1)</b>.
            Otherwise known as the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">Architect</a>, this personality type makes up only 2% of the population.
            Architects have a natural thirst for knowledge and intense curiosity but tend to be private and introverted. This test result I feel accurately describes my
            introverted personality and curiosity but perhaps miss the mark on some other aspects, for example i don't feel that I am arrogant.
        </p>
        <p>
            When working in groups, people with this personality type tend to be very independent so it would be important for me to consider the opinions of others when
            working together to complete tasks. When forming a team it would be important for me to consider selecting personality types that can work with mine effectively.

        <p>
            According to the results of this test <b>(Figure 2)</b> I am a majority visual learner, this means I more readily absorb information if it is presented to me in a visual format.
            This is accurate as I often use visual cues to remind myself of important information. I perform better at on-site fault finding at work than over-the-phone or
            other remote methods since being able to physically look at the piece of machinery or software aids me greatly in fault finding.

            <br>
            Factor 3: Agreeableness -  A person with a score in Agreeableness is friendly and optimistic. My score was a 7 which indicates I
            tend towards being overly critical.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            Factor 5: Intellect/Imagination - People who score low in this category tend towards being traditional and conventional. According
