            E-Paper Board
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Project Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
                With the current market in IoT devices growing exponentially, there is also a growing niche for a centralised control solution that is easy to use, cheap and environmentally
            friendly. E-paper displays are making a splash in the enthusiast electronics scene with their ability to be readily integrated with existing IoT technologies.
            E-Paper or E-Ink displays can be connected to just about any IoT controller like Rhaspberry Pi or Arduinos and will retain the last display programmed even after the controller has been disconnected.
            With touch integration E-Paper screens can be utilised as a home information hub. The screen and controller can be mounted in a place like the kitchen or study where
            it can be used as a scratch pad for writing down lists, chores or any other daily task you wish to track.
        </p>
        <p>
            The advantage that an E-Paper board has over a simple white board is connectivity. With WiFi or 4/5g integration from the embedded controller you can read information from
            your home E-Paper board straight onto a mobile device or PC.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Motivation.
        </h3>
        <p>
            There is a huge growing market for IoT gadgets in Australia, with growth projections putting revenue from IoT devices at
            $25 billion by 2024 ('Australia Internet of Things (IoT) Market By Platform, By Component, By Application, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2024. ResearchandMarkets.com'). There is a definite niche in this
            market for a device that ties all home IoT devices together in one cheap and attractive package. The E-Paper board would act like a current C-Bus controller for all
            domestic IoT devices with added mobile device and home PC integration.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Product Description
        </h3>
        <p>
            The benefits of E-Paper displays over regular displays are that they can be manufactured with an incredibly thin and lightweight form factor. They are easy to view in
            any light conditions and they use minimal power. With the right battery configuration the controller and screen could feasibly last months between recharges whilst
            maintaining a small form factor. The E-Paper display can be disconnect from its controller and it will retain the last image it was displaying allowing you to swap controllers
            or recharge your current controller without losing the data on the screen. The E-Paper screen will come with a variety of bezel options to suit most home decors, or can be used as a desktop display.
            The E-Paper board will include IoT connectivity with other home devices such as smart plugs or light bulbs, allowing centralised control and programming of home automation.
            Smart phone integration will be included with Apps available on the IOs and Android platforms that will allow you to control your E-Paper board remotely, syncing messages with the board and giving you IoT device status updates.
            Live news and weather updates - News and weather feeds from preferred providers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The controller and screen can be sold as separate units or together in a pack, allowing choices in controller complexity or screen size. The E-paper board would do away with
            paper notes, allowing you to make up lists that are shared with your preferred mobile device and across multiple platforms. With IoT integration over a WiFi network, the E-Paper
            board could be used to control other devices throughout the home or workplace. Mobile devices or PCs will  be able to send send information to the board for others to read with an audible notification that
            a note has been posted.  The biggest drawback to E-Paper displays as of now is size, with the largest available currently
            being 12". This should improve over time as the technology is more widely utilised.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Tools and Technologies.
        </h3>
        <p>
            The hardware technologies involved in the prototype stage will be<br>
            <br>
            - Waveshare 9.7" E-Ink Display Hat for Raspberry Pi. <b>(Figure 1)</b><br>
            - Raspberry Pi 3 Model B <b>(Figure 2)</b><br>
            <br>
                The software required for the waveshare display is the BCM2835 libraries to be downloaded and installed onto the Raspberry Pi, Raspbian OS is also required.
            The program for the prototype can be written in C, C++, Python, Scratch or Ruby which all come installed by default on the Raspberry Pi.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Skills required.
        </h3>
         <p>
            A strong knowledge of any of the aforementioned languages is required. Experience with using Raspberry Pi and its native OS is also required as much of the configuration
            of the device will be done in the shell. The software that is required to be written is an application that interfaces between the Raspberry Pi and the display, collecting
            touch inputs, data from networked devices and displaying the GUI. The hardware will be easily sourced as the components are all readily available, the skills required
            to build the application are obtainable due to all software components being open source.
         </p>
        <h3>
            Outcome.
        </h3>
        <p>
            If this project is successful, it will provide a cheap and easy to use home automation controller/information hub that comes with all the advantages of an E-Paper display. This
            project could help bridge the gap between the disparate home IoT devices, providing a central control location. Along side these benefits the E-Paper board will provide
            other useful tools such as scratchpads, list recording and memos to complete the home integration package.
