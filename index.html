            Personal Profile

        <h3>
            Name: Christopher Stephen<br>
            Student ID: s3172455<br>
            E-Mail: cstephen1982@gmail.com<br>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Starting at the beginning, I was born in Scotland at Bells Hill hospital in a town called Coatbridge. I am ethnically
            Celtic and I speak English. My parents immigrated to Australia when I was 5 years old and I have lived in and around Melbourne
            up until now. I live in the Northern Suburbs with my partner and our two dogs. I enjoy hiking, camping, gaming and experimenting
            with enthusiast electronics.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Interest in IT
        </h3>
        <p>
            My interest in computers started when I was very young, perhaps seven years old. My father brought home a Commodore 64
            and I was drawn in by the interactivity of the games on the machine. My interest only developed as I got older and I was able
            to experiment with early DOS based machines. Out of high school I went on to do a Diploma of IT at Box Hill Institute but never
            finished it, instead I decided to do an Electrical Apprenticeship which lead to me becoming a Process Control Technician.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I choose to study at RMIT?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I chose to study at RMIT because I have previously completed a Certificate IV through the TAFE division and I enjoyed
            the experience, it seemed the logical step to continue my studies here. RMIT also offers a strong online learning
            pathway which is adaptable to my work schedule.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What do you expect to learn through your studies?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I expect to obtain a solid grounding in Information Technology with an eye on specifically learning how to program
            in a couple of different languages whilst also building my knowledge in system administration, UNIX based server systems
            and how they integrate with businesses.
