				<p>
				Here is some background on myself. My family immigrated from the UK when I was the tender age of 5 and I have been living in Melbourne
				ever since. Out of highschool I went on to attempt a Diploma of Information Technology which I never finished. Instead I went on to become an Industrial
				Electrician and I've worked in the field for over 15 years. I live in the northern suburbs with my girlfriend and our two dogs Sampson and Chloe.
				Gonna try and ue this intelliJ malarky, see if it will actually commit and push. Why isn't this updating on github?
