			<p style="font-family:courier;">Here's some background on myself, I was born in Scotland and spent the first five years of my life there. My family immigrated to Australia and <br>i've been living in Melbourne ever since. Out of highschool I went Box Hill Institute to do a <br>
			diploma of IT that I never completed, instead I decided to do an Electrical Apprenticeship which landed me a job working in the industrial<br>
			sector where i've been slaving away until now. I've decided to continue my IT studies so this is me, writing a blurb about myself for you<br>
			to read in HTML!</p>
