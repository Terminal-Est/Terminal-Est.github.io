				<p>
				Here is some background on myself. My family immigrated from the UK when I was the tender age of 5 and I have been living in Melbourne
				ever since. Out of High School I went on to attempt a Diploma of Information Technology which I never finished. Instead I went on to become an Industrial
				Electrician and I've worked in the field for over 15 years. I live in the northern suburbs with my girlfriend and our two dogs Sampson and Chloe.
