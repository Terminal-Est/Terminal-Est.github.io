My family immigrated to Australia and i've been living in Melbourne ever since. Out of highschool I went Box Hill Institute to do a diploma of IT that I never completed, instead I decided to do an Electrical Apprenticeship which landed me a job working in the industrial sector where i've been slaving away until now. I've decided to continue my IT studies so this is me, writing a blurb about myself for you to read in HTML!", 10, 50);
