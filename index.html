    <p>
        Here is some background on myself. My family immigrated from the UK when I was the tender age of 5 and I have
        been living in Melbourne
        ever since. Out of High School I went on to attempt a Diploma of Information Technology which I never finished.
        Instead I went on to become an Industrial
        Electrician and I've worked in the field for over 15 years. I live in the northern suburbs with my girlfriend
        and our two dogs Sampson and Chloe.<br>
        I'm just filling in this bit to see if the website automatically scales background sizes. Blah blah blah blah
